# Block Variations tutorial

These are companion files to my [Build Your First Block Variation tutorial on YouTube](https://youtu.be/m6IH-G286DU).

To use these files, download them, and then unzip them to the directory of your choice. In my tutorial, this directory is called `variations-example`.

You can view the final code from the tutorial on the [solution-code branch](https://github.com/ashleykolodziej/professorkexplains-block-variations/tree/solution-code).

You can also see exactly what changed codewise from the beginning of the tutorial to the end of the tutorial by [taking a look at this pull request](https://github.com/ashleykolodziej/professorkexplains-block-variations/pull/1).
